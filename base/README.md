## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, run:
```
./gradlew
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar
To build the final jar and optimize the user application for production, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
```

To ensure everything worked, run:
```
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
```

## Testing
To launch your application's tests, run:
```
./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport
```

### Code quality for developer's to do on local
Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the gradle plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:
```
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```
